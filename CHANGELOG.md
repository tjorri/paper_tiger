# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `init_data` can now seed webhook endpoints with deterministic custom IDs and
  optional caller-supplied signing secrets; omitted IDs and secrets are
  generated. Standalone containers can load the same JSON seed format from the
  path supplied in `PAPER_TIGER_INIT_DATA`.

### Fixed

- Automatic subscription invoice payments now honor subscription and customer
  payment-method/source fallbacks, while invoices with no usable payment
  credential remain unpaid and move applicable updates to `past_due`.
- Subscription item updates now apply as validated deltas: id-less entries add
  items, explicit IDs update or delete only items owned by that subscription,
  and an invalid batch cannot partially mutate subscription data.
- Subscription listing now follows Stripe's documented `status` contract: no
  value excludes canceled subscriptions, `all` includes every status, `ended`
  includes canceled and `incomplete_expired`, and literal statuses continue to
  match directly.
- Standalone container releases now run the bootstrap worker, restoring
  predefined test tokens, configured data sources, `init_data`, and configured
  webhooks. Bootstrap also skips repository readiness checks when no repository
  is configured, which is the standalone release's normal operation.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Standalone server distribution. `mix release` now produces a `paper_tiger`
  release, and a `Dockerfile` builds a container image that serves the same
  Stripe-compatible API the library serves in-process. Any Stripe SDK in any
  language can point its API base at it; no Elixir required on the caller's
  side. Defaults to port 12111, matching stripe-mock, so an existing
  stripe-mock service definition can be repointed without further changes.
- Standalone server configuration via environment variables:
  `PAPER_TIGER_PORT` (and `PORT`), `PAPER_TIGER_CLOCK_MODE`,
  `PAPER_TIGER_CLOCK_MULTIPLIER`, `PAPER_TIGER_BILLING_ENGINE`, and
  `PAPER_TIGER_LOG_LEVEL`.

### Fixed

- Confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent whose `automatic_payment_methods`
  allows redirect-based payment methods (boleto, iDEAL, ...) now requires a
  `return_url`, as real Stripe does. Previously the confirmation was accepted,
  so an integration omitting the parameter stayed green against the mock and
  only failed against the live API. The rejection names the resource and
  returns `param: "return_url"`; `return_url` may be supplied at create or
  confirm time. When `automatic_payment_methods` is absent entirely, Stripe
  falls back to dashboard-configured payment methods PaperTiger does not model,
  so that case is unchanged. Both intents now also store
  `automatic_payment_methods` and `return_url` on the object as Stripe does.
- `POST /_config/time/advance` now accepts form-encoded bodies
  (`seconds=86400`) in addition to JSON. Form encoding is what every Stripe SDK
  emits, so time travel was previously reachable only from hand-written JSON
  requests.
- `GET /health` no longer requires an Authorization header. It is not a Stripe
  endpoint, so gating it bought no fidelity while denying container runtimes and
  load balancers their probe.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-08

### Security

- Hackney floor raised from `~> 1.17` to `~> 1.24` (constraint is now
  `~> 1.24 or ~> 4.0`). hackney 1.24.0 is the least-vulnerable 1.x release — it includes
  the SSRF fix (1.21.0) and the connection-pool fix (1.24.0) — but four advisories
  affecting every release before 4.0.1 (CVE-2026-47071 high; CVE-2026-47075 and
  CVE-2026-47076 medium; CVE-2026-47069 low) were never patched on the 1.x line. The 1.x
  branch exists only so PaperTiger can coexist with dependency trees pinned to hackney 1.x
  by other packages; prefer hackney 4.x whenever your tree allows it.

### Fixed

- Corrected the 1.2.1 release notes: the `PaperTiger.StripityStripeHackney` adapter does
  not require hackney 4.x at runtime — it is a thin passthrough over `:hackney.request/5`
  and works on either line, now verified in CI by a standalone smoke test that resolves
  hackney 1.x and drives the adapter end-to-end (`integration/hackney_1x_smoke`). Note that
  stripity_stripe 3.x itself still requires hackney 4.x, so combining it with
  hackney-1.x-only packages remains unresolvable regardless of PaperTiger's constraint.

### Changed

- Development/CI lockfile refreshed (bandit 1.12, plug 1.20, req 0.6, hackney 4.5, and
  dev/test tooling); published version requirements in `mix.exs` are unchanged. CI now
  tests Elixir 1.18/1.19/1.20 at their latest patch releases.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Hackney constraint loosened from `~> 4.0` to `~> 1.17 or ~> 4.0` so PaperTiger installs
  alongside apps that depend on hackney 1.x (tzdata, sentry 11, swoosh, etc.). The optional
  `PaperTiger.StripityStripeHackney` adapter still requires hackney 4.x at runtime when used.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Request spy for inbound calls now available in test mode.
  `PaperTiger.Test.requests/0` and `PaperTiger.Test.requests/1` return captured requests
  with method/path/params/headers/idempotency_key, plus `clear_requests/0`, `assert_request/3`,
  and `refute_request/3` helpers for request assertions.
- `PaperTiger.Store.Requests` stores per-namespace request entries for API calls, and
  `PaperTiger.Plugs.RequestLogger` records each request at response-time.
- `PaperTiger.Test` cleanup now clears per-namespace request logs with `cleanup_namespace/1`.

### Fixed

- Inbound request recording now respects sandbox-only operation and is bounded per namespace.
  A hard cap (default `:request_log_max_entries`, 500) prevents unbounded request-log growth when
  PaperTiger runs outside test namespaces.

### Changed

- Idempotency semantics now enforce payload matching for reused keys. Requests that reuse an
  `Idempotency-Key` with a different payload now return Stripe-style `400` with code
  `idempotency_key_in_use` rather than replaying a prior response.
- The Elixir compatibility range now explicitly includes the released `1.20` line.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- Reserved auto-selected PaperTiger HTTP ports until Bandit takes ownership of the listener socket, eliminating an intermittent `:eaddrinuse` startup race on Linux CI.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Optional Python SDK contract suite that drives the official `stripe` Python package against PaperTiger over local HTTP, tagged `:python_sdk` and enabled with `VALIDATE_PYTHON_SDK=true`.

### Fixed

- Stripe list filters and CustomerSession component parsing now accept Python SDK boolean serialization (`True` / `False`) in addition to lowercase boolean strings.
- PaymentIntent creation with a `payment_method` now enters `requires_confirmation`, matching Stripe's pre-confirmation state.
- Predefined `pm_card_*` test PaymentMethods now materialize fresh attachable PaymentMethod objects in attach/setup flows, so the same test fixture can be reused across customers without rebinding a singleton.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Pluggable webhook delivery adapter.** `PaperTiger.WebhookDelivery.Adapter` behaviour with a single `deliver/1` callback taking a `PaperTiger.WebhookDelivery.Request` (the signed payload, full headers, signature header, url, event, webhook, namespace) and returning `{:ok, %PaperTiger.WebhookDelivery.Response{}}` (terminal success / ownership taken) or `{:error, reason}` (PaperTiger retries with its existing exponential backoff). Configure with `config :paper_tiger, webhook_delivery_adapter: MyApp.Sink`. Lets a host embedding PaperTiger take durable ownership of webhook delivery via an explicit, enforced contract — a missing or crashing host cannot silently drop webhooks. Default is `PaperTiger.WebhookDelivery.HTTPAdapter`, which performs the HTTP POST exactly as before; **no behavior change when the adapter is not configured.**
- `[:paper_tiger, :webhook, :delivering]` telemetry event, emitted for every delivery in every adapter immediately before the adapter is invoked. Metadata: `event`, `webhook`, `url`, `payload` (exact signed bytes), `signature_header`, `headers`, `timestamp`, `namespace`. **Observability only** — not the delivery mechanism (that is the adapter behaviour). Use for metrics/tracing.
- Stripe-compatible signed webhook request helpers and coverage: `PaperTiger.WebhookDelivery.build_signed_request/3` builds the exact raw JSON body, headers, and `Stripe-Signature` value without delivery, collected webhooks now store the signed body/header, and `PaperTiger.Test.signed_webhook_request/1` exposes those fields for controller tests that call `Stripe.Webhook.construct_event/5`.
- CI quality checks now include Elixir `1.20.0-rc.5`, and the package version requirement accepts the `1.20` release-candidate line.
- Side-by-side contract drift harness for running a scenario against both PaperTiger and Stripe test mode in the same test, normalizing volatile fields, and reporting the first mismatch with both backend shapes. The first live drift scenario covers customer create/retrieve/update/delete.
- Deterministic automatic-tax fixtures for Checkout Session totals, PaymentIntent amounts, initial subscription invoices, and subscription renewal invoices.
- PaymentIntent lifecycle endpoints for `POST /v1/payment_intents/:id/cancel` and `POST /v1/payment_intents/:id/capture`, including manual-capture authorization, partial capture, `amount_capturable` / `amount_received`, captured Charge state, and Stripe-shaped invalid-state errors.
- Checkout Session update and line-item retrieval endpoints, including metadata merge/delete semantics, paginated `GET /v1/checkout/sessions/:id/line_items`, `expand[]=line_items`, and preview-style full-array line item updates for dynamic Checkout tests.
- SetupIntent lifecycle endpoints for `POST /v1/setup_intents/:id/confirm`, `POST /v1/setup_intents/:id/cancel`, `POST /v1/setup_intents/:id/verify_microdeposits`, and `GET /v1/setup_attempts`, including customer attachment for successful card setup, bank-account microdeposit verification, cancellation reasons, failed/abandoned/succeeded SetupAttempt records, and live Stripe contract coverage for confirm/cancel/list-attempts.
- Stripe-style search endpoints for `GET /v1/customers/search`, `GET /v1/subscriptions/search`, `GET /v1/payment_intents/search`, `GET /v1/charges/search`, and `GET /v1/invoices/search`, backed by a shared query parser/evaluator with resource field schemas, metadata predicates, boolean connectors, negation, numeric comparisons, substring matching, search-result pagination, and Stripe-shaped unsupported-query errors.
- Modern payment-method adjunct APIs: test-helper ConfirmationToken creation plus retrieval, PaymentMethodDomain create/retrieve/update/list, PaymentMethodConfiguration create/retrieve/update/list, CustomerSession creation with client secrets, and stored Mandate retrieval for successful mandate-bearing SetupIntent/PaymentIntent flows.
- Invoice lifecycle endpoints for `POST /v1/invoices/:id/send`, `POST /v1/invoices/:id/mark_uncollectible`, and PaymentIntent-backed `POST /v1/invoices/:id/attach_payment`, including `invoice.sent`, `invoice.marked_uncollectible`, and `invoice.voided` webhook emission plus status-transition timestamps.
- Hosted product APIs for Payment Links and Billing Portal: `POST/GET/POST/GET-list /v1/payment_links`, paginated `GET /v1/payment_links/:id/line_items`, browser-visible Payment Link URLs backed by deterministic Checkout Session completion, `POST /v1/billing_portal/sessions`, and Billing Portal Configuration create/retrieve/update/list endpoints.
- Billing discount and credit APIs: Promotion Codes, Customer Balance Transactions, Customer Cash Balance, and Credit Notes with invoice/customer balance mutation for common credit workflows.
- Properly scoped Connect platform APIs: legacy `/v1/accounts`, `POST /v1/account_links`, per-request `Stripe-Account` resource isolation, `POST/GET/POST/GET-list /v1/transfers`, nested transfer reversals, and nested application fee refunds with transfer/fee/reversal balance transaction effects.
- Complete Stripe-style list filtering for Products, Prices, and Refunds, including created-range predicates, documented scalar filters, array filters (`ids[]`, `lookup_keys[]`), Price recurring child filters, list-item expansion such as `expand[]=data.product`, and Refund filtering by Charge or PaymentIntent before cursor pagination.
- SubscriptionSchedule phase/date fidelity for immediate, future, multi-phase, and `from_subscription` schedules: contiguous phase normalization, `duration` and legacy `iterations` derivation, active `current_phase`, schedule-driven subscription/item updates, cancel/release/completion side effects, documented list filters, and live Stripe contract coverage for create/update/cancel/release flows.

### Fixed

- `POST /v1/payment_methods/:id/attach` and `/detach` now emit `payment_method.attached` and `payment_method.detached` webhooks.
- Removed unreachable invoice-proration fallback branches flagged by the Elixir `1.20.0-rc.5` type checker; generated proration lines are unchanged.
- Webhook delivery adapter requests now carry the captured PaperTiger namespace through chaos buffering, async task delivery, retry scheduling, telemetry, and delivery-attempt updates, so host-owned durable adapters can preserve tenant context.
- Subscription item direct store helpers now respect the active PaperTiger namespace for lookup and bulk deletion, matching the shared store isolation used by standard CRUD operations.

### Hardened

- Adapter invocation is wrapped: a raising, exiting, throwing, undefined, missing-`deliver/1`, or wrong-shape-returning adapter is normalized into `{:error, reason}` so PaperTiger's own backoff/retry runs and a delivery attempt is recorded — instead of the spawned delivery task crashing before the retry machinery (and, in sync mode, the linked `Task.async` taking down `PaperTiger.WebhookDelivery`). This is what actually enforces the "a missing or crashing host cannot silently drop webhooks" guarantee.
- Updated direct and transitive dependencies to current compatible releases, including Bandit/Plug security fixes, Credo's Elixir `1.20.0-rc` compatibility fixes, and the Stripity Stripe/Hackney 4 line used by the sandbox HTTP adapter.

### Notes

- The `:webhook_mode` config (`:sync` / `:async` / `:collect`) is unchanged and continues to control *when* delivery is dispatched. The new adapter controls *where/how* the signed request goes. The two are orthogonal.
- `deliver_event_sync/2`'s public contract is unchanged (`{:ok, :delivered | :failed} | {:error, term()}`); adapter handoff does not leak a new return value.
- Connect support intentionally targets Stripe API v1 compatibility first. Accounts v2, Persons, external-account mutation, capability review workflows, Treasury, and Issuing remain explicitly unsupported rather than partially mocked.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- PaymentIntent confirm endpoint (`POST /v1/payment_intents/:id/confirm`) with full Charge and BalanceTransaction creation on success.
- `ChargeHelper` module centralizing Charge + BalanceTransaction creation from succeeded PaymentIntents, used by checkout session completion, BillingEngine, and the new confirm endpoint.
- `latest_charge` field on PaymentIntent objects, populated after successful payment.
- Contract test validating full PaymentIntent -> Charge -> BalanceTransaction chain against real Stripe API.

### Fixed

- Checkout session completion now creates Charge and BalanceTransaction (previously only created the PaymentIntent).
- Currency derivation from `line_items[].price_data.currency` when not explicitly set on checkout session.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Metadata updates now use Stripe merge semantics: new keys are merged into existing metadata instead of replacing the entire map, and keys set to empty string are deleted.

### Changed

- Nix/direnv developer setup is now opt-in (not auto-activated).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Invoice preview endpoints: `GET /v1/invoices/upcoming` and `POST /v1/invoices/create_preview`, including proration line generation and Stripe-style quantity validation.
- Subscription payment-intent lifecycle coverage for `payment_behavior: "default_incomplete"`, including support for `expand=["latest_invoice.payment_intent"]`.
- Coupon/discount support in subscription create/update flows with discount reflection in invoice previews.
- Nix/direnv developer setup support (`flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, `.envrc`) and corresponding README guidance.

### Changed

- `phx.server` startup detection now relies on Phoenix's `:serve_endpoints` signal instead of argv pattern matching.
- Proration invoice creation is constrained to billable subscription changes, reducing spurious invoice generation.
- Chaos API override matching now supports endpoint-specific custom responses and wildcard-prefix path handling.

### Fixed

- `customer.subscription.updated` webhooks now include `previous_attributes`, matching Stripe behavior.
- No-op subscription updates no longer emit redundant webhooks.
- Hydrator expansion now traverses list paths (for example `items.data.price.product`) correctly.
- Customer filtering by `email` and form-encoded card expiration field coercion better match Stripe-compatible behavior.

## [0.9.25] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- `PaperTiger.flush_all/0` to flush data across all namespaces (legacy behavior).

### Changed

- `PaperTiger.flush/0` now flushes only the current namespace (safe for `async: true` test suites using `PaperTiger.Test` sandboxing).
- Updated dependencies: `quokka` `2.12.0`, `plug_cowboy` `2.8.0`, `ex_doc` `0.40.1`.

### Fixed

- ChaosCoordinator config/state is now correctly isolated per namespace, preventing intermittent test failures from cross-test chaos leakage.
- Reduced flaky test assertions in billing engine chaos tests.

## [0.9.24] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Automatic checkout session completion**: Checkout sessions now auto-complete asynchronously, simulating customer completion of the hosted checkout page. For setup mode sessions, when a customer adds a payment method to an incomplete subscription, the first invoice is automatically paid, matching Stripe's production behavior.

## [0.9.23] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed

- **Random port with runtime config**: Port selection is now deterministic even when called from `config/runtime.exs` before PaperTiger starts. The new `PaperTiger.Port` resolver caches the selected port on first call, ensuring both config evaluation and server startup use the same port. This eliminates connection refused errors when using `stripity_stripe_config()` without explicit port. Works with any HTTP client - not tied to stripity_stripe.

## [0.9.22] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- **Random high ports by default**: PaperTiger now picks a random available port in the 59000-60000 range by default, eliminating port conflicts when running multiple instances (tests + dev server, parallel test suites). Port availability is checked before binding, with automatic retry if port is in use. Set explicit port via `PAPER_TIGER_PORT` env var or `port:` option if needed. New `PaperTiger.get_port/0` function returns the actual port selected.
- Fixed all Elixir 1.20 type checker warnings: removed 33 unused `require Logger` statements and fixed typing violation in hydrator module. Paper Tiger now compiles cleanly with Elixir 1.20.0-rc.1 with zero type warnings.

## [0.9.21] - 2026-01-19

### Changed

- Reduced startup log noise by changing initialization messages from `Logger.info` to `Logger.debug` across all Store modules, Application, Bootstrap, and core services. Startup messages are only visible at debug level while operational logs remain at appropriate levels.

## [0.9.20] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Checkout sessions now auto-complete transparently**: Checkout session URLs now point to PaperTiger's own endpoint (`/checkout/:id/complete`) instead of fake Stripe URLs. When visited, the session auto-completes and redirects to `success_url`. This eliminates the need for `paper_tiger_enabled?` checks in application code - checkout flows now work identically in dev/test and production.

## [0.9.19] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- **Chaos testing cleanup function**: Added `ChaosCoordinator.cleanup/0` and `ChaosHelpers.cleanup_chaos/0` that reset chaos configuration AND flush all Paper Tiger stores. Call after chaos testing to prevent test data from being synced to the host application's database.

## [0.9.18] - 2026-01-08

_No changes yet._

## [0.9.17] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **Bootstrap worker for async data loading**: Refactored startup initialization into a dedicated `PaperTiger.Bootstrap` worker that handles async data loading without blocking application startup
- **DataSource behaviour**: New `PaperTiger.DataSource` behaviour enables synchronization of initial billing data from external application databases
- **Payment method sync from database**: StripityStripe adapter now loads existing payment methods and generates placeholders for missing customer `default_source` tokens

### Changed

- **Trialing → active subscription transitions**: Subscriptions updated with a past or `:now` `trial_end` now correctly transition from `trialing` to `active` status
- **`interval_count` optional in recurring prices**: Matches Stripe API specs where `interval_count` defaults to 1 if not provided

## [0.9.16] - 2026-01-07

### Changed

- **StripityStripe adapter now syncs from database instead of Stripe API**: Completely rewrote `PaperTiger.Adapters.StripityStripe` to query local database tables (`billing_customers`, `billing_subscriptions`, `billing_products`, `billing_prices`, `billing_plans`) instead of calling the real Stripe API. This properly mocks Stripe for dev/PR environments using stripity_stripe's local data.

  **Configuration required**: Add to your config:

  ```elixir
  config :paper_tiger, repo: MyApp.Repo
  ```

  **Note**: Auto-sync on startup is disabled when using database sync (repo isn't available at PaperTiger startup). You must manually trigger sync after your application starts, typically in your application's `start/2` callback after the repo is started:

  ```elixir
  # In your application.ex
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [MyApp.Repo, ...]
    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]

    result = Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)

    # Sync PaperTiger from database after repo is started
    if Application.get_env(:paper_tiger, :repo) do
      PaperTiger.Adapters.StripityStripe.sync_all()
    end

    result
  end
  ```

### Added

- **User adapter architecture**: New `PaperTiger.UserAdapter` behavior allows customizing how user information (name, email) is retrieved for customers during sync
- **Auto-discovering user adapter**: `PaperTiger.UserAdapters.AutoDiscover` automatically discovers common user schema patterns including:
  - Email fields: `email`, `email_address`, or foreign key `primary_email_id` → `emails.address`
  - Name fields: `name`, `full_name`, or `first_name + last_name`
  - User tables: `users` or `user`
- **Plan ID support for subscriptions**: Subscription creation now accepts both `price_id` and `plan_id` (legacy) for the `:price` parameter, matching Stripe API behavior. Plans are automatically converted to price format in responses.

## [0.9.15] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **Stripe data sync adapter**: Automatically syncs customer, subscription, product, price, and plan data from real Stripe API on startup when stripity_stripe is detected. Solves the problem of dev/PR apps losing subscription data on restart. Sync adapter is pluggable via `PaperTiger.SyncAdapter` behavior for custom implementations.

### Changed

- **Reduced debug logging**: Removed per-operation debug logs from store operations (insert/update/delete/clear) and resource creation. Startup logging is now more concise with single-line summaries.

## [0.9.14] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **`init_data` priv paths now work in releases**: Paths starting with `priv/` (e.g., `init_data: "priv/paper_tiger/init_data.json"`) are now automatically resolved by searching all loaded applications' priv directories. This fixes init_data not loading in releases where the working directory differs from the project root.

## [0.9.13] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed

- **Mix.env() check at runtime, not compile time**: Dependencies are compiled in `:dev` environment by default, so the compile-time `@mix_env` module attribute was always `:dev` even when running tests. Now checks `Mix.env()` at runtime (after verifying Mix is available) to correctly detect test environment.

## [0.9.12] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed

- **Namespace isolation for InvoiceItem**: Fixed `InvoiceItem.list` to properly filter by namespace, preventing test isolation leaks when listing invoice items.

## [0.9.11] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed

- **Mix.env() called at compile time**: Fixed crash in releases where `Mix.env()` was called at runtime but Mix isn't available in releases. Now captured at compile time via module attribute.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **`PaperTiger.StripityStripeHackney` for automatic sandbox isolation**: New HTTP module that wraps `:hackney` and injects namespace headers for test isolation when using stripity_stripe
  - Configure stripity_stripe with `http_module: PaperTiger.StripityStripeHackney`
  - Works with child processes (LiveView, async tasks) via shared namespace in Application env
  - `checkout_paper_tiger/1` now automatically sets up shared namespace for child process support

### Changed

- **`checkout_paper_tiger/1` sets shared namespace via Application env**: Child processes (like Phoenix LiveView) can now automatically access the same PaperTiger sandbox as the test process without additional configuration

## [0.9.9] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Pre-defined Stripe test payment method tokens**: PaperTiger now provides all standard Stripe test tokens (`pm_card_visa`, `pm_card_mastercard`, `pm_card_amex`, `tok_visa`, etc.) out of the box
  - Card brand tokens: visa, mastercard, amex, discover, diners, jcb, unionpay (plus debit/prepaid variants)
  - Decline test cards: `pm_card_chargeDeclined`, `pm_card_chargeDeclinedInsufficientFunds`, `pm_card_chargeDeclinedFraudulent`, etc.
  - Tokens are loaded at startup and persist across `flush()` calls
  - Test tokens work in namespace-isolated tests via global namespace fallback

## [0.9.8] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **Contract tests use pm*card*\* tokens**: PaymentMethod contract tests now use Stripe test tokens (`pm_card_visa`, `pm_card_mastercard`, `pm_card_amex`) instead of raw card data, which works with both PaperTiger mock and real Stripe API

## [0.9.7] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **Invoice `charge` field matches real Stripe behavior**: Draft invoices no longer include the `charge` key at all (not nil, just absent), matching real Stripe API behavior

### Added

- **Centralized test card helpers**: `TestClient.test_card/0` for real Stripe API testing and `TestClient.test_card_simple/0` for PaperTiger-style card data

## [0.9.6] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **`get_optional_integer/2` helper**: Distinguishes "key not present" from "0" for optional integer params like `trial_end`
- **`normalize_integer_map/1` helper**: Converts string integer values in maps (e.g., form-encoded params) to actual integers
- **Auto-create Plan for recurring Prices**: When `Price.create` is called with `recurring` params, a matching Plan object is automatically created (Stripe legacy API compatibility)

### Fixed

- **Subscription default status is "active"**: Fixed bug where subscriptions without trial periods incorrectly defaulted to "trialing" status
- **Explicit status parameter respected**: `Subscription.create` now respects explicit `status` param instead of always computing it
- **Subscription list filtering**: Uses `list_namespace/1` for proper namespace-scoped queries instead of undefined store methods

## [0.9.5] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **Subscription items include `plan` field for backwards compatibility**: Stripe API populates both `plan` and `price` on subscription items. PaperTiger now does the same via `build_plan_from_price/1`.
- **PaymentMethod.create supports custom IDs**: Use `id` parameter to create payment methods with deterministic IDs for testing.
- **Contract tests for subscription item plan field and payment method custom IDs**

### Fixed

- **Price.recurring now includes `interval_count`**: Added `build_recurring/1` function that defaults `interval_count` to 1 when not specified, matching Stripe API behavior.
- **Invoice list filtering by status**: Fixed status filter to work correctly with string status values.
- **PaymentMethod.list now requires customer parameter**: Matches real Stripe API behavior. Returns empty list without customer param.
- **PaymentMethods.find_by_customer uses proper namespacing**: Fixed ETS query to use namespace-scoped keys for test isolation.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **ChaosCoordinator for unified chaos testing**: New module consolidating all chaos testing capabilities
  - Payment chaos: configurable failure rates, decline codes, per-customer overrides
  - Event chaos: out-of-order delivery, duplicate events, buffered delivery windows
  - API chaos: timeout simulation, rate limiting, server errors
  - Statistics tracking for all chaos types
  - Integrated with `Invoice.pay` for realistic payment failure simulation

- **Contract tests for InvoiceItem, Invoice finalize/pay, and card decline errors**

### Fixed

- **Subscription status now matches Stripe API exactly** (e.g., `active` vs `trialing`)
- **TestClient normalizes delete responses** with `deleted=true` field
- **Card decline test assertions** check correct fields

### Changed

- **Clock uses ETS for lock-free reads**: `now/0` reads directly from ETS instead of GenServer call, avoiding bottleneck under load
- **Hydrator uses compile-time prefix registry**: No runtime map traversal for ID prefix lookups
- **Idempotency uses atomic select_delete**: Fixes potential race condition
- **ChaosCoordinator uses namespace isolation**: Per-namespace ETS state with proper timer cancellation on reset
- **Store modules export `prefix` option** for Hydrator registry
- **Tests use `assert_receive` instead of `Process.sleep`** for reliability

## [0.9.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **Test sandbox for concurrent test support**: New `PaperTiger.Test` module provides Ecto SQL Sandbox-style test isolation
  - Use `setup :checkout_paper_tiger` to isolate test data per process
  - Tests can now run with `async: true` without data interference
  - All stores now support namespace-scoped operations
  - Automatic cleanup on test exit
- **HTTP sandbox via headers**: `PaperTiger.Plugs.Sandbox` enables sandbox isolation for HTTP API tests
  - Include `x-paper-tiger-namespace` header to scope HTTP requests to a test namespace
  - New `PaperTiger.Test.sandbox_headers/0` returns headers for sandbox isolation
  - New `PaperTiger.Test.auth_headers/1` combines auth + sandbox headers
  - New `PaperTiger.Test.base_url/1` helper for building PaperTiger URLs

### Changed

- **Storage layer uses namespaced keys**: All ETS stores now key data by `{namespace, id}` instead of just `id`
  - Backwards compatible: non-sandboxed code uses `:global` namespace automatically
  - New functions: `clear_namespace/1`, `list_namespace/1` on all stores
  - Idempotency cache also supports namespacing

## [0.9.2] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Proper Stripe error responses for missing resources**: Instead of crashing, PaperTiger now returns the same error format as Stripe when a resource doesn't exist
  - Returns `resource_missing` error code with proper message format: "No such <resource>: '<id>'"
  - Includes correct `param` values matching Stripe (e.g., `id` for customers, `price` for prices)
  - HTTP 404 status code for not found errors

### Added

- Contract tests verifying error responses match Stripe's format

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Events missing `delivery_attempts` field**: Events created via telemetry now include `delivery_attempts: []` field, fixing KeyError when accessing this field

### Added

- **Auto-register webhooks from application config on startup**: PaperTiger now automatically registers webhooks configured via `config :paper_tiger, webhooks: [...]` when the application starts, eliminating need for manual registration in your Application module

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Subscription `latest_invoice`**: Now populated with the actual latest Invoice object for the subscription instead of always being null
- **PaymentIntent `charges` field removed**: Real Stripe API does not include `charges` on PaymentIntent - charges are accessed via separate endpoint `GET /v1/charges?payment_intent=pi_xxx`. PaperTiger now matches this behavior.
- **Charge `balance_transaction`**: Successful charges now create and link a BalanceTransaction with proper fee calculation (2.9% + $0.30)
- **Refund `balance_transaction`**: Refunds now create and link a BalanceTransaction with negative amounts
- **Contract tests now run against real Stripe**: Removed all `paper_tiger_only` tagged tests. All contract tests now pass against both PaperTiger mock and real Stripe API.

### Added

- **Checkout Session completion support**: New endpoints for completing and expiring checkout sessions
  - `POST /v1/checkout/sessions/:id/expire` - Expires an open session (matches Stripe API)
  - `POST /_test/checkout/sessions/:id/complete` - Test helper to simulate successful checkout completion
  - Based on mode, creates appropriate side effects:
    - `payment`: Creates a succeeded PaymentIntent
    - `subscription`: Creates an active Subscription with items
    - `setup`: Creates a succeeded SetupIntent
  - Fires `checkout.session.completed` and `checkout.session.expired` webhook events
  - Creates PaymentMethod and fires `payment_method.attached` event on completion
- **Environment-specific port configuration**: New env vars `PAPER_TIGER_PORT_DEV` and `PAPER_TIGER_PORT_TEST` allow different ports per Mix environment. Enables running dev server and tests simultaneously without port conflicts. Precedence: `PAPER_TIGER_PORT_{ENV}` > `PAPER_TIGER_PORT` > config > 4001.
- `PaperTiger.BalanceTransactionHelper` module for creating balance transactions with Stripe-compatible fee calculations

### Removed

- **PaymentMethod raw card number support tests**: Tests using raw card numbers don't work with real Stripe API. Use test tokens like `pm_card_visa` instead.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **Synchronous webhook delivery mode**: Configure `webhook_mode: :sync` to have API calls block until webhooks are delivered. Useful for testing where you need to assert on webhook side effects immediately after API calls.
- `WebhookDelivery.deliver_event_sync/2` function for explicit synchronous delivery

## [0.8.4] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Subscription items now return full price object**: `subscription.items.data[].price` is now a full price object (with `id`, `object`, `currency`, etc.) instead of just the price ID string, matching real Stripe API behavior
- Same fix applied to `subscription_item.price` when creating/updating subscription items directly
- When price doesn't exist in the store, returns a minimal price object with required fields for API compatibility

### Added

- Contract test validating subscription item price structure against real Stripe API
- `TestClient.create_product/1` and `TestClient.create_price/1` helpers for contract testing

## [0.8.3] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- Remove unused `cleanup_payment_method/1` function that caused warnings-as-errors CI failure

## [0.8.2] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Contract test fixes**: Tests now properly pass the API key to all stripity_stripe calls
- **PaymentMethod and Subscription tests**: Skipped for real Stripe (require tokens/pre-created prices that can't be created via API) - these test PaperTiger's convenience features
- **Clearer test mode messaging**: Contract tests now display "RUNNING AGAINST REAL STRIPE TEST API" with explicit "API key validated as TEST MODE"

## [0.8.1] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **Live key safety guard**: `TestClient` now performs two-layer validation before running contract tests against real Stripe:
  1. Validates API key prefix (rejects `sk_live_*`, `rk_live_*`)
  2. Makes a live API call to `/v1/balance` and verifies `livemode: false`

  This prevents accidental production usage even if someone crafts a key with a fake prefix

### Fixed

- BillingEngine now retries existing open invoices instead of creating duplicates on each billing cycle
- Subscriptions correctly marked `past_due` after 4 failed payment attempts

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- `PaperTiger.BillingEngine` GenServer for subscription billing lifecycle simulation
- Processes subscriptions whose `current_period_end` has passed
- Creates invoices, payment intents, and charges automatically
- Fires all relevant telemetry events for webhook delivery (invoice.created, charge.succeeded, etc.)
- Two billing modes: `:happy_path` (all payments succeed) and `:chaos` (random failures)
- Per-customer failure simulation via `BillingEngine.simulate_failure/2`
- Configurable chaos mode with custom failure rates and decline codes
- Integrates with PaperTiger's clock modes (real, accelerated, manual)
- `invoice.upcoming` telemetry event support in TelemetryHandler
- Enable with config: `config :paper_tiger, :billing_engine, true`

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- Custom ID support for deterministic data - pass `id` parameter to create endpoints for Customer, Subscription, Invoice, Product, and Price resources
- Enables stable `stripe_id` values across database resets for testing scenarios
- `PaperTiger.Initializer` module for loading initial data from config on startup
- Config option `init_data` accepts JSON file path or inline map with products, prices, and customers
- Initial data loads automatically after ETS stores initialize, ensuring data is available before dependent apps start

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- Automatic event emission via telemetry - resource operations (create/update/delete) now automatically emit Stripe events and deliver webhooks
- `PaperTiger.TelemetryHandler` module for bridging resource operations to webhook delivery
- Comprehensive Stripe API coverage including Customers, Subscriptions, Invoices, PaymentMethods, Products, Prices, and more
- ETS-backed storage layer with concurrent reads and serialized writes
- HMAC-signed webhook delivery with exponential backoff retry logic
- Dual-mode contract testing (PaperTiger vs real Stripe API)
- Time control (real, accelerated, manual modes)
- Idempotency key support with 24-hour TTL
- Object expansion (hydrator system for nested resources)
- `PaperTiger.stripity_stripe_config/1` helper for easy stripity_stripe integration
- `PaperTiger.register_configured_webhooks/0` for automatic webhook registration from config
- Environment variable support: `PAPER_TIGER_AUTO_START` and `PAPER_TIGER_PORT`
- Phoenix integration helpers and documentation
- Interactive Livebook tutorial (`examples/getting_started.livemd`)
